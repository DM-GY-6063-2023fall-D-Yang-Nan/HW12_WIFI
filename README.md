# p5js + Arduino
I was going to use the APDS9960 sensor to control the direction of the fireworks with gestures, but since my sensor hasn't arrived yet this week, I used two buttons to test it out, using two buttons to control the direction of the circle moving in p5js. The circle moves left when the left button is pressed and right when the right button is pressed. I used the wifi template. Next week I will gradually replace the buttons with APDS9960 sensors and the fireworks rising direction with the circle moving direction.
